# Vanguard 10U 2023 - 2024 Season

The 10U Coed Program at [Vanguard Aquatics](https://www.vanguardaquatics.com) strives to be a safe, positive, and _highly competitive_ environment for young athletes to learn, grow and build connections, and groups of friends for years to come.

To provide the kind of experience we think is most valuable for our athletes, we highly encourage as much attendance as possible and communication about athletes' schedules.

I have been involved with the group since 2014 and have had the absolute privilege of watching athletes create some incredible memories and gain friendships that have all lasted to this day, in high school and college, and developed into some of the best water polo players in the country.

## Who is this for

Athletes can start competing as early as 7 years old. All ages are welcome.
Everyone that has trained with us in August is well prepared to compete in the 10U season.

## History - 10U Coed @ National Junior Olympics

## Comparison to Splash Ball

Vanguard Aquatics is an elite water polo club. Our focus is to introduce athletes to a more competitive atmosphere and prepare them for games. Splashball is recreational and serves to introduce new kids to the sport. We encourage athletes to transition to 10U once they feel they would like to start competing and would like a more challenging environment.
