# Vanguard 10U 2023 - 2024 Season

The 10&Under Coed Program at [Vanguard Aquatics](vanguardaquatics.com) strives to be a safe, posative and _highly competative_ environment for young athletes to learn and grow and build connections, and groups of friends for years to come.

In order to provide the kind of experience we think is most valuable for our athletes, we highly encourage as much attendance as possible and communication about athletes' schedules.

I have been invovled with the group since 2014 and have had the absolute privledge of watching athletes create some incredible memories gain friendships that have all lasted to this day, in high school and college, and developed into some of the best water polo players in the country.

## Who is this for

An athlete's age for each season is determined by their age _August 1st of the end of that season_. So for the 2023 - 2024 season you are 9&Under if you turn 10 after August 1st, 2023. And you are an 8&Under if you turn 9 after August 1st, 2023. etc.

Typically athletes begin competing on the team as a 8&Under or 9&Under. 10&Under is obviously great as well, but certainly athletes in this range of gained so much from the program and that is what we hope to have a good mix of on the team every year. If you are an 8&Under or 9&Under then you will be preparing yourself for a more successful 10&Under season when it comes to that.

There is **_NO ONE_** that trained with us in August that is not ready for the 10&Under team.

## Tournaments & Events

We compete in about 1 tournament a month. Theses will last two days and the times are TBD, but will generally include 2 games per day.

10&Under Water Polo is played 5 v 5. And depending on the number of atheltes we might create multiple teams for tournaments, either by even split, age, ability, experience, attendance, or split into Boys & Girls teams.

Tournaments encure an additional cost, but scrimmages do not. A scrimmage is generally a single game against another team, and a tournament is a series of games against multiple teams.

| Tournament                     |      Date      |         Location |

## Comparission to Splash Ball

Vanguard Aquatics is a Competative Water Polo Club. And our focus is to introduce athletes to competative water polo and quickly bring them into the competative environment. Although SplashBall is a great introduction to the sport, it is not competative and does not provide the same level of social connection and accountability that we think is most valuable for young athletes.
